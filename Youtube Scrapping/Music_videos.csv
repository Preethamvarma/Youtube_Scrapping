allowing us to share her journey. She beat cancer. We're so honored to have Jesse here
from the Tyler Robinson Foundation. Tyler and I had a deep love for music, and that love for music led
us to meet imagine dragons. And as Tyler battled cancer as a teenager. We formed an amazing
relationship with them, which led to the creation of
the Tyler Robinson foundation. Which supports families
battling pediatric cancer. We are so excited to set up
this fundraiser to donate as much money as possible, for the Tyler Robinson foundation. So we would like you to donate now. And we're gonna start. Drum roll, please. All right, so we want to be the first
to start this fundraiser. $10,000, to the Tyler Robinson foundation. Click this link below this fundraiser. We want to raise tons of
money for these families. This is gonna be amazing, you guys. It's gonna be awesome. Thank you. We're so excited. You guys saw the story of Avery. That touched our hearts. So donate now. Go team BRAVERI! You can find out more about her
story on our fantastic five. You can help in two ways. Share this video and help us get
5 million awareness views for TRF. And,
donate to help us reach our goal of $100, 000 for kids with cancer."

I know why they talk like that, because everything doesn’t always go as planned. Whatever happens, have the courage to say`tha pathukalam’, Feeling sad about what’s already gone is a time waste. “Stand tall before a society that stabs you when you're down"" said poet’u Dhanush the great! but people keep spreading hate illogically.

Is this all lyrics? was these written by Asal Kolaar? he is not Asal Kolaar,  he is complete Kolaar! “Y’all will see one day” At five, they gave me beatings  and made me realize that crying is a waste which is how I became strong..  Uncomfortable situations will shape your maturity - and wisdom, am i right ? Even from stealing, you learn tricks and strategies, but there’s so much more to experience in life. Few backstab you to get bigger,  few get stomach burn from those who are already bigger. Should i bring a fire engine?! don’t hide and see  Like a fake ID ""Sivaranjini underscore 15"". to those who give illegal entry and cause problems, Ill attack and chase them out  like Donald Trump! `Asal Kolaar - Chikkom  Yelra Teasta’ If I get bored, I’ll go around in my dad’s boat along the coast.  Even if I go to Kuala Lumpur,  I’ll still speak thandaiyarpetta slang.  I’ll eat local food there, like dosa, and also some h*es. You file a CBI complaint?  I’ll drain your UPI account. If you comment in URL, ill break your face in IRL. Hey, Do you even know where this guy comes from? You talk like you know something, don’t say a word.  Oh man, he’s such a notorious guy, isn’t he? That’s no one else—it’s me, I'm that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Who’s that guy?  Who’s that guy?  Who’s that guy?  Who’s that guy? "
